# THE SPARKS FOUNDATION 
<li> Hi I made this website to integrate payment gateway for <b>The Sparks Foundation</b> Task as Web and Mobile Developer Intern.</li>
<h2 color="green">PAYMENT GATEWAY INTEGRATION</h2>
<p><br>-Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated. There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking<p>
<p>-The donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc</p>
 <p>-Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.</p>
 <p>On any page / email, only basic information is needed.</p>
 <p>-Create your own temporary / sandbox/testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations.</p>
 <p>Host the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free hosting provider. Check in code in gitlab.</p>
